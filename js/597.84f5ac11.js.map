You may withdraw any unutilized and cleared funds held in your player account by\r\n              submitting a withdrawal request in accordance with our withdrawal conditions. The minimum\r\n              withdrawal amount per transaction is € 10 (or equivalent in other currency) with the exception of\r\n              an account closure in which case you may withdraw the full balance.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>9.2.

All withdrawals must be made to the original debit, credit card, bank account, method of\r\n              payment used to make the payment to your Account. We may, and always at our own\r\n              discretion, allow you to withdraw to a payment method from which your original deposit did not\r\n              originate. This will always be subject to additional security checks.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>9.5.

Payment Transactions and Processors</h5>\r\n          <p>10.1. You are fully responsible for paying all monies owed to us. You must make all payments to\r\n              us in good faith and not attempt to reverse a payment made or take any action which will cause\r\n              such payment to be reversed by a third party in order to avoid a liability legitimately incurred.\r\n              You will reimburse us for any charge-backs, denial or reversal of payment you make and any\r\n              loss suffered by us as a consequence thereof. We reserve the right to also impose an\r\n              administration fee of €50, or currency equivalent per charge-back, denial or reversal of payment\r\n              you make.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>10.2. We reserve the right to use third party electronic payment processors and or merchant\r\n              banks to process payments made by you and you agree to be bound by their terms and\r\n              conditions providing they are made aware to you and those terms do not conflict with these\r\n              Terms.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>10.3. All transactions made on our site might be checked to prevent money laundering or\r\n              terrorism financing activity.

In the event of an error or malfunction of our system or processes, all bets are rendered\r\n              void. You are under an obligation to inform us immediately as soon as you become aware of\r\n              any error with the Service. In the event of communication or system errors or bugs or viruses\r\n              occurring in connection with the Service and/or payments made to you as a result of a defect or\r\n              error in the Service, we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any direct or indirect\r\n              costs, expenses, losses or claims arising or resulting from such errors, and we reserve the right\r\n              to void all games/bets in question and take any other action to correct such errors.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>11.2. We make every effort to ensure that we do not make errors in posting bookmaker lines.\r\n              However, if as a result of human error or system problems a bet is accepted at an odd that is:\r\n              materially different from those available in the general market at the time the bet was made; or\r\n              clearly incorrect given the chance of the event occurring at the time the bet was made then we\r\n              reserve the right to cancel or void that wager, or to cancel or void a wager made after an event\r\n              has started.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>11.3. We have the right to recover from you any amount overpaid and to adjust your Account to\r\n              rectify any mistake. An example of such a mistake might be where a price is incorrect or where\r\n              we enter a result of an event incorrectly. If there are insufficient funds in your Account, we may\r\n              demand that you pay us the relevant outstanding amount relating to any erroneous bets or\r\n              wagers. Accordingly, we reserve the right to cancel, reduce or delete any pending plays,\r\n              whether placed with funds resulting from the error or not.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h5>12.  Rules of Play, refunds and cancellations</h5>\r\n          <p>12.1. The winner of an event will be determined on the date of the event's settlement, and we\r\n              will not recognize protested or overturned decisions for wagering purposes.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>12.2. All results posted shall be final after 72 hours and no queries will be entertained after that\r\n              period of time. Within 72 hours after results are posted, we will only reset/correct the results due\r\n              to human error, system error or mistakes made by the referring results source.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>12.3. If a match result is overturned for any reason by the governing body of the match within\r\n              the payout period then all money will be refunded.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>12.4. If a draw occurs in a game where a draw option is offered all stakes on a team win or lose\r\n              will be lost. If a draw option is not offered then everyone receives a refund in the outcome of a\r\n              draw on the match. And if a draw option has not been made available, then extra time will count,\r\n              if played.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>12.5. If a result cannot be validated by us, for instance if the feed broadcasting the event is\r\n              interrupted (and cannot be verified by another source) then at our election, the wagers on that\r\n              event will be deemed invalid and wagers refunded.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>12.6. Minimum and maximum wager amounts on all events will be determined by us and are\r\n              subject to change without prior written notice. We also reserve the right to adjust limits on\r\n              individual Accounts as well.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>12.7. Customers are solely responsible for their own Account transactions. Once a transaction\r\n              is complete, it cannot be changed. We do not take responsibility for missing or duplicate wagers\r\n              made by the Customer and will not entertain discrepancy requests because a play is missing or\r\n              duplicated. Customers may review their transactions in the My Account section of the site after\r\n              each session to ensure all requested wagers were accepted.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>12.8. A matchup will have action as long as the two teams are correct, and regardless of the\r\n              League header in which it is placed on our Website.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>12.9. The start dates and times displayed on the Website for eSport matches are an indication\r\n              only and are not guaranteed to be correct. If a match is suspended or postponed, and not\r\n              resumed within 72 hours from the actual scheduled start time, the match will have no action and\r\n              wagers will be refunded. The exception being any wager on whether a team/player advances in\r\n              a tournament, or wins the tournament, will have action regardless of a suspended or postponed\r\n              match.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>12.10. If an event is posted by us with an incorrect date, all wagers have action based on the\r\n              date announced by the governing body.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>12.11. If a team is using stand-ins, the result is still valid as it was the team's choice to use the\r\n              stand-ins.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>12.12.

If we suspect that you are or receive notification that you are currently under 18 years or\r\n              were under 18 years (or below the age of majority as stipulated in the laws of the jurisdiction\r\n              applicable to you) when you placed any bets through the Service your Account will be\r\n              suspended (locked) to prevent you placing any further bets or making any withdrawals from\r\n              your Account. We will then investigate the matter, including whether you have been betting as\r\n              an agent for, or otherwise on behalf, of a person under 18 years (or below the age of majority as\r\n              stipulated in the laws of the jurisdiction applicable to you).

The failure of us to enforce at any\r\n              time any term or condition of these Terms shall not be construed to be a waiver of such\r\n              provision or of the right of us to enforce such provision at any other time.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>26.4.
